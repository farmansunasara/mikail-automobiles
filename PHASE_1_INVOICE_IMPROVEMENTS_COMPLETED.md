## 🚀 **KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED**

### **Stock Management Fixes**
```php
// BEFORE: Stock was lost on invoice deletion
$invoice->items()->delete();
$invoice->delete();

// AFTER: Stock is properly restored
foreach ($invoice->items as $item) {
    $this->stockService->inwardStock(
        $item->product, 
        $item->quantity, 
        "Stock restored from deleted Invoice #{$invoice->invoice_number}"
    );
}
```

### **Stock Validation**
```php
// NEW: Prevents overselling
foreach ($request->items as $item) {
    $product = Product::find($item['product_id']);
    if ($product->quantity < $item['quantity']) {
        throw new \Exception("Insufficient stock for {$product->name}");
    }
}
```

### **Status Management**
```php
// NEW: Complete invoice lifecycle tracking
$invoice->markAsPaid($amount, $date, $method);
$invoice->isOverdue(); // true/false
$invoice->amount_due; // calculated remaining amount
```

### **Enhanced Filtering**
```php
// NEW: Advanced search and filtering
if ($request->filled('status')) {
    $query->where('status', $request->status);
}
if ($request->filled('overdue') && $request->overdue == '1') {
    $query->where('due_date', '<', now())
          ->where('status', '!=', 'paid');
}
